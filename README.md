## Name
CODE-REFACTOR FOR A WEBSITE

## Description
This is a Bootcamp work challenge, where a website has been given and I have to refactor the website by making sure I do not change the existing website. The website has a lot of divs. I have to make sure the website is structured properly so that other coders can see the section, the main, and footer when they inspect the website. It contains notes on HTML, CSS AND GIT.
